# Professional Summary
summary: |
  I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Interactive Artificial Intelligence CDT seeking an industry research internship. My work focuses on developing neurosymbolic methods to build robust, explainable, and generalisable autonomous agents. I am interested in applying AI to high-stakes, human-in-the-loop domains such as energy, security, and defence. In these critical settings, I strive to build AI systems that are robust, reliable, and transparently audited by humans, ensuring accountability and ethical alignment. My research mainly focuses on leveraging symbolic AI techniques, such as logic programming and program synthesis, to enable agents to learn and reason about their environments online. Outside my main research area, I have experience in deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling and physics-informed neural networks.

# Experience
experience:
  - institution: University of Bristol
    position: Teaching Assistant
    location: Bristol, UK
    dates: 2024-2025
    responsibilities:
      - Data Science Project Unit - Supervised and mentored postgraduate Data Science students on industry-sponsored group projects, guiding research design, experimentation, and reporting. Acted as the primary liaison between student teams and corporate partners, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones and clear communication of technical findings.
      - Machine Learning Unit - Assisted in delivering lectures and practical sessions on machine learning topics to undergraduate Computer Science students. Provided one-on-one support during lab sessions, helping students understand complex concepts and debug code.
      - Artificial Intelligence Unit - Supported the teaching of symbolic AI fundamentals as well as multi-agent systems to third-year Computer Science undergraduates. 

  - institution: Lukkap
    position: Data Scientist Intern
